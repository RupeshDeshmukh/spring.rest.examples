# REST Services Using Spring
Repository with examples demonstrating implementation of REST services using Spring

<p>
<h2>Spring REST Basic (spring-rest-basic)</h2><br />
This is very basic "Hello World" implementation of REST service using spring. It uses Spring Boot to host the service hence no separate server is required. At root directory fire maven command: mvn spring-boot:run or if you have Spring STS plugin installed in your Eclipse you can directly import this project and run it as Spring Boot Application. The example is self explanatory. Refer to the Java Docs for more information about various Spring annotations used.

<h2>Spring REST Advance (spring-rest-advance)</h2><br />
This is more advance example that demonstrates CRUD REST Services implemented using Spring. You can use any server to deploy this example. Just build the example using Maven and deploy the war.<br />
